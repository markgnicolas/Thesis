## Abstract
The temporary discontinuance of educational institutions globally is one of the apparent impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. To address this issue, many schools accepted a new paradigm and shifted their effort to adopting online education. Maintaining the same learning level from face-to-face classes is going to be a challenge for both professors and students due to a lot of factors, such as students’ learning environment and the absence of direct communication and feedback in online education. In this paper, we have presented a web application equipped with a convolutional neural network that analyzes and monitors the student’s emotions according to their facial expressions to classify the affective state in real-time such as enjoyment, hope, pride, anger, anxiety, shame, hopelessness, boredom, fear, sadness, surprise, and neutral. The researchers evaluated the accuracy, precision, and recall of the model using Confusion Matrix. Having an 81.16% accuracy, 81.96% average precision, and 81.13% average recall. The proposed application aims to help the professors adjust their teaching strategies accordingly and improve the efficiency of online teaching as a result.
